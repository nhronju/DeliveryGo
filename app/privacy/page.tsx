                         At DeliveryGo, we are committed to protecting the privacy of your data. This policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. We believe in being transparent and straightforward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         We do not use third-party advertising, and we do not sell your data to brokers. The information we collect is used solely to provide our service to you.

                    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
                    <p>
                         DeliveryGo is a product of Asionis Technology Ltd., a company registered in the UK.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. Data We Collect and Why We Collect It</h2>
                    <p>
                         We only collect data that is essential for the DeliveryGo app to function. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the information we collect and the purpose behind it:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                         <li><strong>Phone Number:</strong> We collect your phone number for secure authentication and to identify your account. This is our primary way of ensuring only you can access your data.</li>
                         <li><strong>Precise Location:</strong> If you give us permission, we use this data for the driver tracking feature and to accurately calculate mileage for wage reports. You can turn this permission off at any time in your device settings.</li>
                         <li><strong>Photos:</strong> The app uses photos (delivery slips, addresses) for the "Find Address by Photo" feature, which requires camera access. We process these photos to extract information and then discard them; we do not store them.</li>
                         <li><strong>User IDs and Usage Data:</strong> We use unique IDs to manage your account and collect anonymous usage and performance logs. This helps us find and fix bugs, and improve the overall app experience.</li>
                         <li><strong>Business Data:</strong> This includes information you input, such as driver names, shift times, delivery details, expenses, and wage rates. This is the core data required to provide our driver management service.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. How We Use and Share Your Data</h2>

                    <p>
                         We may share data with a small number of trusted **service providers** to help us operate the app. These providers are contractually bound to protect your data and are not allowed to use it for any other purpose. This includes:
